# AgentHub Business Plan

**Autonomous AI Workforce Platform for SMBs**

*Prepared: February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

AgentHub is a SaaS platform that deploys autonomous AI agents to handle routine business operations for small and medium businesses (SMBs). Unlike chatbots that wait for prompts, AgentHub agents proactively execute tasks—categorizing transactions, responding to emails, scheduling appointments, and chasing invoices—24/7 without human intervention.

The platform addresses a critical market gap: SMBs need operational efficiency but can't afford dedicated specialists for every function. AgentHub delivers enterprise-grade automation at a fraction of traditional staffing costs, with 12 specialized AI agents covering finance, operations, marketing, HR, and customer support.

**Key Metrics Target (Year 1):**
- Monthly Recurring Revenue: $125,000
- Active Customers: 200
- Average Revenue Per User: $625/month
- Gross Margin: 75%

## Market Opportunity

### The Problem

Small and medium businesses face an impossible tradeoff:

1. **Hire specialists** → $50K-$80K/year per role, plus benefits, training, and turnover costs
2. **Outsource** → $2K-$10K/month per function, with limited control and inconsistent quality
3. **Do it themselves** → Owners spend 60% of time on administrative tasks instead of growth

The result: 67% of SMB owners report being "overwhelmed" by operational tasks, and 40% say administrative burden is their top barrier to growth.

### The Solution

AgentHub replaces this tradeoff with a third option: deploy AI agents that cost 80-90% less than human equivalents, work around the clock, and scale instantly.

| Function | Traditional Cost | AgentHub Cost | Savings |
|----------|------------------|---------------|---------|
| Bookkeeper | $4,500/month | $199/month | 96% |
| Social Media Manager | $4,000/month | $149/month | 96% |
| Customer Support Rep | $3,500/month | $249/month | 93% |
| Scheduling Coordinator | $3,200/month | $99/month | 97% |
| Collections Specialist | $4,000/month | $299/month | 93% |

### Market Size

- **Total Addressable Market (TAM):** $127B (global SMB software market)
- **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):** $18B (SMB automation and AI tools, US)
- **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):** $180M (early-adopter SMBs seeking AI operations tools)

Target segments with highest propensity to adopt:
- Professional services firms (accounting, legal, consulting)
- Healthcare practices (dental, medical, veterinary)
- Auto dealerships and service businesses
- E-commerce and retail operations
- Contractors and trades businesses
